# Developer Portal
This project is a magical portal between developers and an imaginary API. In other words, this is a sample frontend for developer portal to offer a smooth user experience for API users. 

The project contains a generic explorer component that can be used to display request headers and parameters as well as to get sample responses. Local JSON file is included for local testing but in deployed version API is faked with https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.

Project is built with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8., Angular 5, and Material Design.
